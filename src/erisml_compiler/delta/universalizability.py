"""Kantian universalizability test for the deontic projection.

The pre-v0.8.x gate was a hardcoded set `{"deceive", "impose_externality"}`
of action_kinds that trip the gate. This module replaces that with a
principled test grounded in Kantian categorical-imperative semantics.

## Background

Kant identified two ways the categorical imperative can be violated:

1. **Contradiction in Conception (CIC).** Universalize the maxim. If
   the resulting universal law is *internally incoherent* — if the
   universalized act becomes impossible because it presupposes an
   institution that the universalization destroys — the maxim cannot
   be willed without contradiction. Lying presupposes truth-telling;
   universalizing lying destroys the institution; lying becomes
   impossible. False promises, cheating, theft fall here.

2. **Contradiction in Will (CIW).** Universalize the maxim. The
   universal law is coherent (the act remains possible) but the
   *agent* cannot rationally will it because doing so would defeat
   their own broader ends. Universal refusal to help others is
   coherent (people can decline to help), but a rational agent
   cannot consistently will it: they themselves will need help at
   some point. Indifference to suffering, refusing aid, neglect
   fall here.

## Implementation strategy

For each `action_kind` we know how to handle, we record:
  - which institution(s) the act *presupposes*
  - whether universalizing the act destroys those institutions (CIC)
  - whether universalizing the act defeats agent's typical ends (CIW)
  - a brief justification anchored to a Kantian primary source

When the gate runs, we look up the action_kind, return the
classification, and surface the institution + contradiction-type +
justification in the GateFinding's detail block. Unknown action_kinds
return `passed=True` (we can't run the test without knowing the
institution) and record `result=undetermined` rather than silently
passing.

## What this is

  - A principled lookup table grounded in Kantian textual semantics,
    with each entry citing the form of contradiction.
  - Auditable: every gate firing surfaces *which* institution would
    be destroyed and *why*.
  - Extensible: callers can pass a custom mapping to test alternate
    institutional interpretations.

## What this is NOT

  - Not a real universalised-world model. We don't actually build
    the universalized-world ontology and run a coherence check on
    it. That would require a much richer semantics — possible
    future work via SMT solving over action-institution graphs.
  - Not the final word on contested cases. Several action_kinds
    (e.g. "disclose") are non-universalisable-by-some-readings and
    universalisable-by-others. We pick a defensible reading and
    record the contestability in `detail.contested_reading`.
